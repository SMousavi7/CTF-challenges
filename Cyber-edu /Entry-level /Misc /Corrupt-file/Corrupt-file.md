# Discription of question
I cannot recover flag.docx.zip because it looks like a corrupt file! Can you help me?
# Solution
First we download the file. Then, we unzip the file and encouter with a .docx file. We change the name of the file to **flag.zip**. Again we unzip this new file and we got the flag. This is because a .docx file
is a kind of a zip file. You can even do this with your own .docx files and see what you get.

**flag: DCTF{a0bd4e405bc4e1fcf840c7c231181970e2b6fde7c60d4a0a415897bf07f8e17b}**
