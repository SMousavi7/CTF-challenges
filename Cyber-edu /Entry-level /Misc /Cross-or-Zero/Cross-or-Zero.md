# Description of the question:
Can you find the key and the flag? I bet. It is not an encryption. It is ZERO.
# Solution:
In this question they gave us a python file which has a base64 encoded string in it. The purpose of this question is to use **Cyberchef** tool. We take that string and put that in to cyberchef. Then we bring base64 module and xor module and get the flag.

**flag: DCTF{c1e700d3eff2749b41c435c1227001f0e58c08ad340f0b7495fc0f6967e017b9}**
